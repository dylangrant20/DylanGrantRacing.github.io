Files in this package:
- index.html, about.html, career.html, gallery.html, sponsors.html, contact.html

How to host:
- Option 1: GitHub Pages - Create a new repository, upload the files, then enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings (select the main branch / root).
- Option 2: Netlify - Drag & drop the folder on Netlify's "Sites" dashboard or connect a Git repo and deploy.
- Option 3: Any static host - upload the folder contents to your web host or serve locally with a simple HTTP server (e.g. 'python -m http.server' in the folder).

If you want changes (colors, copy edits, extra pages), tell me what to update and I'll regenerate the files.
